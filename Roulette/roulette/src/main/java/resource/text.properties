rules.rules=European roulette is a popular casino game that at a first glance may appear as a very complicated game to learn. After all it uses so many different features. There is the roulette table with different markings on it, the roulette wheel and the roulette ball.It is no wonder then that some people get intimidated when they witness the excitement that surrounds a game of European roulette as the fear of the unknown is actually greater than the reality of how complex the game really is. Often people are surprised to find out just how easy it is to learn and play European roulette.The Basics of European RouletteWhen playing European roulette in a land casino or live-dealer European roulette in an online casino there would be up to 8 players, all playing against the casino. Each player gets different colored chips so their bets are not confused with other players\u2019 bets.The croupier (sometimes called the dealer) handles the game and is responsible for spinning the wheel, dropping the ball on the wheel, announcing the winning number and paying the winners. The croupier is also the one who dictates when players are not allowed to make any more bets.When playing European roulette in online casinos on a software-run European roulette game there are no other players at the table. You are playing against the software that is governed by a Random Numbers Generator that guarantees the game is random and fair.The Objective of European RouletteWhen you play European roulette you only have one objective and that is to correctly predict on which of the numbered slots on the roulette wheel the roulette ball will land. Guessing correctly will make you a winner and award you a payout for the winning bet you made.Types of European Roulette BetsThere are two types of European roulette bets; inside bets and outside bets. The inside bets offer very high payouts but a lower chance of occurring, while the outside bets offer much lower payouts but the odds of winning these bets are much higher.Basic European roulette strategy advises to stick to outside bets and avoid making inside bets in spite of their highly tempting payouts.European Roulette Table Limits Every gambling game at the casino has betting limits. Table games always display the betting limit on a small sign at the side of the table. Be sure to check the table limits before you start to play. Make sure you are not making bets that are too low or high for the roulette table you selected because if you make a mistake the croupier will call you on it and you will need to change your bet. European Roulette Etiquette European roulette is a classy game and players are expected to maintain a code of etiquette around the roulette table. Make sure to never argue with the croupier and always listen to their instructions. Also respect other players around the table and make your bets during the appropriate time frame so you do not cause delays.
strategy.game= Martingale Roulette System \u2013 This is a system that involves increasing bets after a loss until you get a win. It is commonly used on Red or Black but it can be applied all over the table if you have the correct progression. Not only have we gone through every bet, we have tables showing the overall loss at each stage and we\u2019ve shown you the odds of going on a bad losing run i.e: 10 Reds in a row when you\u2019re betting on Black.\u23CE\u0009Reverse Martingale \u2013 Also known as \u201CParoli\u201D, this is a positive progression system where you increase your bets after a win in the hopes of riding a winning streak while keeping the losses to a minimum when you go on a losing run.\u23CE\u0009D\u2019Alembert Roulette System \u2013 This is a strategy that is based on even chance bets. It\u2019s a relatively safe system to use (like any strategy there\u2019s risk involved though) and if you have as many wins as losses you will have a nice win.\u23CE\u0009Reverse D\u2019Alembert \u2013 This is the opposite of the regular D\u2019Alembert (above). The main downside of this system is that you need more wins than losses in order to be successful.\u23CE\u0009Fibonacci Roulette System \u2013 This is an interesting strategy that uses a slower rate of progression than the Martingale by winning back losses over several winning spins rather than one. It\u2019s possible to have considerably more losing spins but still come out on top, providing of course that you don\u2019t go on an extended losing run over a short space of time.\u23CE\u0009Reverse Fibonacci \u2013 Another example of a system having the rules flipped around to create a \u201Creverse\u201D version. In our opinion, this one isn\u2019t as good as the normal Fibonacci which we covered above.\u23CE\u0009Labouchere Roulette System \u2013 This is sometimes called the cancellation method because you construct your own betting line and cancel numbers off it as you win. It is slightly more complicated than most other strategies and may require some practice to get your head around it.\u23CE\u0009Cover The Table \u2013 On this page we talk about several different ways that you can cover large portions of the roulette table such as betting on 35 numbers, betting on 17 splits and so on.\u23CE\u0009Flat Betting \u2013 On this page we talk about the upsides and downsides to flat betting which means betting the same amount on every spin with no progression.\u23CE\u0009Oscar\u2019s Grind \u2013 This is a Red/Black system that play in stages of four and aims to get a profit of 1 unit for each betting cycle. It increases bets after every win and they remain the same after a loss.\u23CE\u0009Red And Black Strategies \u2013 This is a page that contains links to all the different strategies that we\u2019ve covered that can be used on Red or Black which are by far the most popular bets.\u23CE\u0009Dozens And Columns \u2013 Here we talk about two different betting systems that can be used on either the dozens or the columns. The first is designed for betting on just one dozen or column, the second is for betting on two at the same time.\u23CE\u0009James Bond Roulette System \u2013 Used by Bond himself, not in any of the films, but in the written novels. This is a system that covers 2 thirds of the table, plus the 0. It could be described as another strategy to cover the table but due to it\u2019s notoriety, we\u2019ve given it it\u2019s own page, complete with a diagram, examples and whey you shouldn\u2019t use a progression.\u23CE\u0009FOBT System \u2013 Short for fixed odds betting terminal, these machines are found in bookmakers throughout the UK and they are big business. Here we discuss whether or not there are any systems that can be applied specifically to them and then we go into whether or not it\u2019s possible to cheat on them. Spoiler Alert: it\u2019s not.\u23CE\u0009Roulette Computers \u2013 These are cheating devices that, realistically, can only be used in real casinos. Without doubt, the use of an effective computer is the best and easiest way to win at roulette, but finding such a device is difficult. Then there\u2019s the fact that in many countries and jurisdictions, they\u2019re illegal and you will end up in jail for using one, so for this reason, we can\u2019t recommend them.\u23CE\u0009Roulette Tips \u2013 Here is a collection of 8 roulette tips that should be helpful to new or intermediate players. You won\u2019t find anything new or ground breaking here, but we truly believe that this is the best collection of tips that you\u2019re going to find on the Internet. The reason for that is because we keep it real, we don\u2019t make false claims about \u201Cwinning a fortune\u201D like other websites; we just give useful tips to help you understand the game.
